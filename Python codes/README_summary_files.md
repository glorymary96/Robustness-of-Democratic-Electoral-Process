# Summary of the files

1. Model_execution.py : A simple execution of the model.
2. Even_distribution_val.py : Program for the validation of the model using House of Representative elections (2012-2020) of United States.
3. Polarization_bias.py : Program to study the effection of polarization and bias on the effort needed to change the election outcome.
4. Robustness_biparty.py : Program to evaluate the robustness of different electoral system to external influences for a two-party electoral system for a generic case and case study on US House of Representative elections.
5. Nat_opn_generator.py : Program to generate the natural opinion with equal density and volume for each party.
6. Strategies_w0.py : Program to arbitarily define the influence vector supporting each of the party.
7. Robustness_multiparty_single_electoral_unit.py : Program to implement the robustness of the electoral system in a single electoral unit for different values of confidence bound parameter.
8. Electoral_system_function.py : A program with functions to calculate the effort needed to change the election outcome following different electoral systems.
9. Robustness_multiparty_multiple_electoral_unit.py : Program to find the effort needed to change the election outcome following different electoral systems using different sub-programs within the program.
10. Multiparty_robustness_single_orsering.py : Program to implement the robustness of the electoral system in a single electoral unit for Plurality system with just ordering (without reduction of volume of parties at the center) and different values of confidence bound parameter.
11. Multiparty-robustness-single-DES.py : Program to implement the robustness of the electoral system in a single electoral unit for different electoral systems and different values of confidence bound parameter.
